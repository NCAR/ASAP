Allison Baker, a member of the ASAP team, was recognized for her contributions towards high performance computing within the Supercomputing 2024 series featuring contributions from individuals in the field of HPC.  In the article, Allison talks about her start in HPC. "The "Introduction to Parallel Computing Course" that I took my first year was my initial exposure to HPC, but the internship at Argonne National Lab the following summer got me hooked. I saw firsthand that HPC was facilitating the development of large and complex software codes that accelerate scientific discovery through simulation."  Allison's current work involves improving climate models by addressing the computational challenges that computing advances bring about.  Specifically, she uses her expertise in Applied Mathematics to ensure that complex Earth science codes are running correctly on diverse compute architectures and different types of Supercomputers.
