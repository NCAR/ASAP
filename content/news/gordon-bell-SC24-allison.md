Last November, Dr. Allison H. Baker was part of the team that won the 2024 ACM Gordon Bell Prize for Climate Modeling.  She was part of a 12-member team that was lead by researchers from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).  They're work titled, “Boosting Earth System Model Outputs and Saving PetaBytes in Their Storage Using Exascale Climate Emulators.”, looked at how emulators could be used to study the Earth's climate at ultra-high resolutions.

“A climate emulator is a statistical model designed to mimic the behavior of a climate model... to generate new data or predict outcomes for new inputs more cheaply than running the full climate model.” — Dr. Allison H. Baker
